Simple asteroids game as a proof that I can make a game. Arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot. Arrow keys and enter to select menu items. I got some inspiration from the pygame chimp example, and the book titled Pygame 4000 (and obviously asteroids). The code is my own.

It is open to use at your own risk for commercial and non commercial purposes, just give credit where it is due.

Feel free to give me suggesstions or feedback. 

The only dependency besides python3 is pygame. 

Special thanks to the creators of pygame and python to make this possible. Check out the book Pygame 4000
