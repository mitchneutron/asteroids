Simple asteroids game as a proof of concept that I can make a game. Arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot. Arrow keys and enter to select menu items. I got some inspiration from the pygame chimp example, and the book titled Pygame 4000 (and obviously asteroids). The code is my own.

It is open to use at your own risk for commercial and non commercial purposes 

Feel free to give me suggesstions or feedback. 

The only dependency besides python 3 is pygame. 

Special thanks to the creators of pygame to make this possible. Check out
